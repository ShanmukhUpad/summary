Hi I'm Shanmukh! I am really interested in video game & VR/AR development. 
In school, I'm currently taking Data Structures and a C programming/GDB/UNIX Commands course. 
I hope to start some personal projects related to game development in the future.
In high school, I started my Computer Science journey with AP CSP and CSA where I learned JavaScript & Java.
In college, I am now learning C and C++ and I hope to use these programming languages in future projects.
